# Bach Chorales Figured Bass dataset (BCFB)
BCFB includes 103 Johann Sebastian Bach chorales with figured bass encodings in MusicXML, **kern, and MEI formats, based on the Neue Bach Ausgabe (NBA) critical edition. This work has been accepted by Music Encoding Conference 2020. The files be found within the folder `FB_source`. 

Within the folders `FB_source/translated_kern` and `FB_source/translated_kern`, you can find 105 symbolic files. This is because both BWV 10.07 and BWV 161.06 have two different versions based on NBA. Within the folder `FB_source/musicXML_master`, you can find 143 symbolic files, more than 105 files found in other two folders. This is because we are currently working on adding more Bach chorales with figured bass encodings from NBA, and once this is finished, we will convert the additional musicXML files to **kern and MEI.

The files used in the experiments of figured bass encoding and conversion can be found within the folder `FB_encoding_and_translation_experiment`.

The metadata of these chorales can be found in `Reference Table.xlsx`.
